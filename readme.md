You can read our CryptoBinary artifact evaluation documentation to learn how to run each tool we evaluated. This GitHub page contains only the source code of our cryptographic function benchmark due to GitHub’s file size limitations. To access the full tools’ source code and the compiled benchmark binary programs, please download them from our server. More information on how to access our server is provided in the documentation. We will transfer our compiled benchmark binary programs and the source code for each tool to a permanent server for easier access in the future.
